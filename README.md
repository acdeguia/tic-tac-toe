### Objective
* Create a gameplay system that is contained within an immediately invoked function expression.
* Only return variables that are necessary for updating the player objects and scoreboard.
* Ensure that any variables not returned are undefined within the global scope.
* Minimize the use of the global scope as much as possible.
